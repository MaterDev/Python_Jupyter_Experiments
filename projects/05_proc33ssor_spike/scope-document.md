# Proc33ssor: Scope Document

## Project Abstract

**Proc33ssor** is a standalone application designed to analyze and catalog a large archive of images on a local machine. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and image processing algorithms, the tool will generate detailed metadata for each image. This metadata will be stored in a local database, enabling efficient searching and retrieval of images based on various criteria. The application will include a user-friendly web interface built with React, providing an intuitive image exploration experience.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Prototype Development (Python Notebook)

**Objective:**
Develop a prototype focusing on processing a single image, then extend to multiple images.

**Tasks:**

1. **Image Tagging:** Implement image tagging using a locally hosted LLM.
2. **Pixel Data Analysis:** Analyze and display metrics for a sample image.
3. **Unique Identifier Embedding:** Embed a unique identifier into a sample image.
4. **Additional Metrics:** Implement and display results for dominant color detection and object detection.
5. **Database Storage:** Store and retrieve data in a local database.
6. **Natural Language Search:** Implement basic search functionality.
7. **Loop Implementation:** Extend functionalities to process multiple images in a directory.
8. **Version Control:** Embed `proc33ssVersion` in each image and store version history in the database.

### Phase 2: Standalone Application Development (GO, React/Redux)

**Objective:**
Convert the prototype into a standalone application with a web interface.

**Backend Development (GO):**

1. **API Development:** Develop RESTful API for image processing.
2. **Concurrency Handling:** Use Goâ€™s concurrency features to process multiple images simultaneously.
3. **Database Integration:** Integrate a local database (e.g., SQLite) for efficient data storage and retrieval.
4. **Natural Language Search API:** Implement API endpoint for search functionality.
5. **Version Control API:** Implement endpoints to track and update `proc33ssVersion` and version history.

**Front-End Development (React/Redux):**

1. **Search Interface:** Develop a user-friendly search interface using React and Redux.
2. **Image Display:** Create components to display search results.
3. **User Authentication:** Implement authentication and authorization.
4. **Real-Time Updates:** Implement real-time updates for database changes.

**Deployment:**

1. **Local Deployment:** Ensure easy installation and execution on local machines.
2. **Containerization:** Optionally use Docker for deployment consistency.
3. **Monitoring and Maintenance:** Implement logging and monitoring tools.

**Command-Line Interface (CLI):**

1. **Launch Service:** `proc33ssor start` to launch services and open the web interface.
2. **Restart Service:** `proc33ssor restart` to restart services.
3. **Stop Service:** `proc33ssor stop` to stop all services.
4. **Status Check:** `proc33ssor status` to check service status.
5. **Upgrade Version:** `proc33ssor upgrade <version>` to update the environment variable to a new version.
6. **Set Version:** `proc33ssor set-version` to check the database for the latest version and reset the environment variable accordingly.

By focusing initially on processing a single image and then scaling to handle multiple images concurrently, **Proc33ssor** can be developed from a basic prototype to a fully functional standalone application with a web interface. The inclusion of version control and a command-line interface will enhance usability and maintainability by providing commands to manage the application services and track processing versions.
