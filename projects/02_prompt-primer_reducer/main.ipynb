    "\n",
    "A GPT Primer file, often used with OpenAI's language model, is a YML file that consists of metadata used to influence, constrain, and contextualize ChatGPT responses. This notebook will help you create a reduced version of such files, improving efficiency, reducing token usage, making for more consistent outputs."
