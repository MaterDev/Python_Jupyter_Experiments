# Small-Data Science Projects Ideas

"Small data" refers to datasets that are small enough to be comprehended by a human, understood in context, and analyzed directly. Despite their size, small datasets can still be rich in insights and useful for solving real-world problems. Working with small data often involves techniques such as data visualization, exploratory data analysis, and traditional statistical methods. 

Here are 20 diverse ideas for small-data science projects. Each project includes a brief description and a difficulty rating from 1 (easiest) to 5 (most challenging).
