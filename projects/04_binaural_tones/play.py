    ⚠️ Experimental
    Generates and plays a continuous sine wave tone of a specified frequency.
    
    Parameters:
    - frequency (float): The frequency of the tone in Hertz (Hz).
    
    This function generates a sine wave of the specified frequency and plays it 
    continuously until the global exit_signal is set. The sound is played through 
    the default audio output device of the system.
    
    ⚠️ Warning:
    Listening to high-volume tones, especially through earphones, can cause 
    hearing damage or discomfort. Users should lower the volume before playing 
    the tones, and raise it cautiously to a comfortable level. Listening to 
    tones generated by this function through earphones is done at the user's own risk.
    
    Example:
    >>> play_tone(440)  # Plays a tone of 440 Hz
