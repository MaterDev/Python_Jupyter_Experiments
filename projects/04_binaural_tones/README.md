# Binaural Tones: Multi-tone Generator

> This project provides a script to generate and play multiple sine wave tones simultaneously.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This script has been tested with Python 3.8 but should work with other 3.x versions as well.

Before you can install pyaudio, you will need to install `portaudio`. On macOS, you can do this using Homebrew:

```bash
# macOS
brew install portaudio
```

Install the required python libraries:

```bash
pip install pyaudio numpy
```

## Usage

1. Edit the `frequencies` list in `play_tones.py` to include the frequencies (in Hz) of the tones you wish to play.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python play_pyaudio.py
```

The script will play the tones continuously until it is interrupted (e.g., by pressing `Ctrl + C` in the terminal).

## Warning

Listening to high-volume tones, especially through earphones, can cause hearing damage or discomfort. Users should lower the volume before playing the tones, and raise it cautiously to a comfortable level. Listening to tones generated by this script through earphones is done at the user's own risk.

## Example

```python
frequencies = [33, 34]  # Frequencies in Hz
play_tones(frequencies)
```

This will play three tones simultaneously at 33 Hz, and 34 Hz.
